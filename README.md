# Lite
Lita, who had long since lost her heart to Fita, has recently realized that Fita does not care about Lita because she is overweight. Therefore, 
Litte has decided to bring her weight and body to the ideal fit as soon as possible.

After much deliberation, Litte concludes that she should never eat foods that have a health label. 
The Health Guide Label provides information on sugar, fat, salt, trans fatty acids and protein. 
And we know that a health label is dangerous if at least one of the following conditions is met:

    At least three items are red.
    At least two are red and at least two are yellow.
    All items should be yellow or red. (That is, we should not be green!)
   so we must write a code to tell lite when he need eat carefully when he does not .
   nakhor lite= dont eat lite
   rahat bash= take it easy
